# What-Are-Micron-Cartridge-Filters-and-Why-Do-You-Need-Them-in-Water-Treatment-
As the name suggests, Micron Cartridge Filters are filters that filter the water to a designated Micron rating. This is achieved with the help of special cartridge filters housed in the filter vessel. <br>

Cartridge filters are used to remove solids and other unwanted particles from the water. These filters are installed in a water treatment plant or an RO plant to remove dirt and chemicals from the water. <br>

Although cartridge filters are made from many materials, most micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India prefer using polypropylene as it resists the growth of bacteria. They can also be made from wound string, rigid foam or pleated film. Filters made from thermally bonded polypropylene microfibers ensure high efficiency and have a rigid polypropylene centre core for increased collapse strength and durability. This thermally-bonded microfiber design provides a low fibre release rate, a steady flow rate, and excellent filtering performance. It's also not as fragile as resin-bonded cartridges. <br>

The solid material gets trapped on the micron cartridge filter when water passes through this filter. The filters are placed according to the size of the particles. For example, first a cartridge filter of 20-micron filter, then a 5-micron filter and in the end a 1-micron filter. However, this can change with the type of water that is made to pass through the filter. <br>

**What Can and Cannot the Micron Cartridge Filters Remove?** <br>
Micron cartridge filters can remove sediments, metals, and even microorganisms from the water. For the smooth and efficient functioning of the cartridge filters, the correct size filters must be installed. The filters work best when the water passing through them has been pre-treated by the use of other filtering techniques. <br>

This means that the micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India produce filters that are mainly used in water treatment like: <br>

•	**Pre-filtration units in Reverse Osmosis Plants** <br>
RO systems are most effective when it comes to purifying water that has previously been filtered. Because sediments and particles are rejected by RO membranes, they become harmful to reverse osmosis systems. Clogging issues can emerge fast, reducing the overall pressure that the system is capable of producing and, as a result, lowering the recovery ratio and output. This is why Micron Cartridge filters are used in RO plants. In heavily contaminated water, cartridges are used as final polishing filters. <br>

•	**Pre- and post-filtration units in ultraviolet-based drinking water plants** <br>
UV water sterilizers also require cartridge filters. While the ultraviolet water treatment procedure works by using UV rays to damage the DNA of living organisms, rendering them unable to grow and spread, it is readily interrupted. To guarantee that your UV system performs at its best, a cartridge filter with a 5-micron rating is recommended. <br>
•	Sediment filtration in Water filtration Plants <br>
•	Pre-filtration and final filtration processes in drinking water plants<br>
•	Removing general debris or chemical precipitates in the water <br>

**What Are the Benefits of Using Cartridge Filters in Water Treatment?** <br>
1. Cartridge filters help in removing suspended solids. They also help prevent membrane fouling. <br>
2. Bacteria ranging from 0.2 to 2 microns can be easily removed with the cartridge filters. <br>
3. The micron cartridge filter helps decrease the SDI, turbidity and colour of the water. <br>
4. A good <a href="https://arvindkaigo.com/services/membrane-and-filters/kaicf.php">micron cartridge filter for industries in India</a> is easy to maintain and keeps costs to a minimum. They are relatively cheap, compact and require minimum maintenance other than changing the cartridge. <br>
5. Micron cartridge filters are disposable and easily replaceable. <br>
6. They have higher flow rates and great filter accuracy. <br>
7. Unlike other types of filters, a cartridge filter is easier to maintain. <br>
8. Cartridge filters also reduce energy consumption through less pump pressure. <br>
9. They can eradicate unwanted particles as small as 10-15 microns. <br>
10. Cartridge filter systems are modular, and increasing or lowering the number of filters or filter arrays can potentially accommodate any flow rate. <br>

Remember that your cartridge filter must be replaced about once every six months to one year. Micron cartridge filter manufacturers in India recommend keeping an eye on your water pressure to know when it is time for a replacement. As soon as a pressure drop is noticed, steps must be taken to change sediment filters. <br>
